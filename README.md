# BNN_SFHs
We will build a Bayesian Neural Network framework to estimate the SFHs of galaxies from spectra via simulation based inference.

1. We generate a datastet (spectra and mass quantiles) from parametrizations of SFHs (check generate_input.py).
2. We use SPENDER to encode in latent vectors (low dimension representations) the spectra.
