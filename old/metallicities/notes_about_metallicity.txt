Metals: mass fraction of all elements heavier than He
▸ Solar metallicity: Z☉=0.020
▸ Metallicity is usually represented as an abundance:
▸ [Z/H]=log(Z/H)-log(Z☉/H☉)=log(Z/0.020)
▸ It is common to approach [Z/H] with the abundance one element (usually Fe): [Fe/H]

You are training with values of [Z/H] from -2.3 to 0.26 (it should be to 0.40 but you can change it later)

Zmin=0.020 * 10**(-2.3)= 0.0001
Zmax=0.020 * 10**(0.26)= 0.0364
Zmax=0.020 * 10**(0.40)= 0.0502
